Objective : 
    Implement a linked list that can 
        . add a new value 
        . print the list 
        . search for an existing value;

Special about LL
    data structure where values are chained sequentially 
    more efficient for insertion and deletion than arrays 
    does not require contigous memory as arrays

Recursive linked list: 
    Implementive recursive methods to 
        add a new value to a ll;
        print the list;
