What is a tree? 
    There is one root 
    There is only one unique path between two nods
    Root node because there is no parent 
    Leaf nodes because there are no children
    Levels : Same distance from the root 
        0 level --> Root node 
    Height : The largest level 

What is a binary tree? 
    Tree where each node has at most two children 
    
Depth First Traversal
    Travel as far as to a leaf before visiting other branches

1. InOrder   V-L-R
    Time : O(n) Space : O(m) where m is the height of hte tree 
2. PreOrder  L-V-R
    Time : O(n) Space : O(m) where m is the height of hte tree 
3. PostOrder L-R-V
