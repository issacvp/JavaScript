Objectives :
    . Explain what a graph 
    compare tand contrast 
    Implement a graph using an adjacent matrix 
    Traverse through BFS and DFS 


    Graph   == Nodes + Connections 


    Graph terms : 
        Vertex : a node 
        Edge : Conneciton between nodes 
        Weighted /Unweighted  values assigned to distances between vertices
